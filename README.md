# Mantis: Unified Performance Monitoring for HPC

**Mantis** is an open-source Python toolkit that streamlines performance monitoring and profiling in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. It wraps and unifies diverse monitoring tools to deliver a consistent, user-friendly experience—empowering researchers and developers to collect, analyze, and compare application performance across heterogeneous systems with ease.

## 🚀 Why Mantis?

Performance monitoring is essential in HPC, but it’s often complex, fragmented, and error-prone. Existing tools are powerful—but inconsistent in interfaces, output formats, and usage constraints. Mantis addresses this challenge by:

- 🧩 Operating entirely in user space—no root, kernel modules, or system hooks required.
- 📄 Using a single, structured YAML configuration file to define monitoring tasks.
- 🛠️ Orchestrating a wide range of profiling and monitoring tools behind the scenes.
- 📊 Producing unified, analysis-ready outputs in structured formats like JSON, CSV, Parquet, and Pandas.
- 🔁 Enabling repeatable and portable performance experiments across HPC environments.

## 🧰 Key Features

- **Unified Tool Integration**  
  Seamlessly wraps heterogeneous profiling and monitoring tools:
  - Linux `perf`, `/proc`, `time`
  - GPU profilers (`nvprof`, `ncu`, `rocprof`, `nvidia-smi`, `amd-smi`)
  - Facility-level metrics (IPMI, energy sensors, etc.)

- **Consistent Data Output**  
  All tools report into a standardized, extensible schema compatible with flat (CSV/XML) and rich (JSON/Parquet/Pandas) formats.

- **No Code Modifications**  
  Mantis runs alongside your applications—no source code changes, instrumentation, or recompilation required.

- **Modular and Extensible**  
  Clean object-oriented design makes it easy to plug in new tools or output formats with minimal boilerplate.

- **Portable and Lightweight**  
  Runs on local systems, clusters, and supercomputers with no site-specific dependencies.

- **Research-Ready**  
  Replace fragile bash pipelines with reproducible YAML configurations and structured outputs.

- `/proc` virtual filesystem

### **GPU**
- NVIDIA: `nvidia-smi`, `nvprof`, Nsight Compute (`ncu`)
- AMD: `amd-smi`, `rocprof`, uProf

### **Power and Platform**
- IPMI (node-level energy, thermals, fans)
- Facility tools (e.g., HPCM support in progress)

### **Other**
- Time-to-completion collectors
- Environment and runtime metadata

See the [documentation](https://github.com/mseryn/mantis-monitor/wiki) for a full list and configuration examples.

## 🧱 Architecture

Mantis follows a clean, modular design to ensure extensibility and transparency:

- **Configuration**  
  All experiments are described in YAML, specifying target programs, monitoring tools, environment variables, and output preferences.

- **Benchmark Module**  
  Launches target applications with precise control over environment and inputs.

- **Collector Module**  
  Coordinates profiling tools and captures their outputs.

- **Formatter Module**  
  Normalizes and exports collected data into user-friendly formats for downstream analysis.

## 🧬 The Unified Data Schema (UDS)

At the core of Mantis is its **Unified Data Schema (UDS)**: a structured, extensible format that abstracts and unifies metrics from all supported tools.

The UDS is:

- Tool-agnostic
- Compatible with flat and nested formats
- Easily queryable using standard Python libraries or SQL
- Designed for merging, comparison, and statistical analysis

See the [Unified Data Schema documentation](https://github.com/mseryn/mantis-monitor/wiki/Unified-Data-Schema) for schema structure and usage examples.

## ⚡ Quick Start

1. **Install Mantis**  
   *(Recommended: use a Python virtual environment)*

   ```bash
   pip install mantis-monitor
   ```

2. **Write a YAML Configuration File**  
   Define your experiment parameters and monitoring tools. See [example configs](https://github.com/mseryn/mantis-monitor/wiki/Configuration-Examples).

3. **Run Your Experiment**  
   ```bash
   mantis-monitor path/to/config.yaml
   ```

4. **Analyze Output**  
   Unified results are exported as JSON, CSV, or other formats—ready for scripting, visualization, or publication.
